### June 10th, 2019. *Civil disobedience to stop ecocide*.

Roger Hallam, co-founder of *Extinction Rebellion*,
talks about mass denial and the failure of the 'Elites' 
regarding the issue of Climate Change. 
The main points of this interview, from the words of Roger are:

Roger: "one of the main things that is avoided by the establishment as it were
is to look at feedback mechanisms which were already baked into the system ...
one is the carbon lag ... and then there's something called global dimming which means
that when you have removed the fossil fuels from the system, that
reduces the pollution levels and that lets through more of the sun's rays
and that warms the Earth up ..."

About the *carbon lag*, the FAQ point 12.3 of the IPCC report 2013 states:

"... As a result of the multiple time scales in the climate
system, the relation between change in emissions and climate
response is quite complex, with some changes still occurring
long after emissions ceased. Models and process understanding
show that as a result of the large ocean inertia and the long lifetime
of many greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, much of the
warming would persist for centuries after greenhouse gas emission have 
stopped... if concentration of greenhouse were
held constant at present day level, the Earth surface would still
continue to warm by about 0.6‚Å∞C over the 21st century relative to the 
year 2000. This is the climate commitment to current concentrations
(or constant composition commitment), shown in grey in FAQ 12.3, Figure 1.
... Eliminating short-lived negative forcings from sulphate
aerosols at the same time (e.g. by air pollution reduction measures)
would cause a temporary warming of a few tenths of a degree, as
shown in blue in FAQ 12.3, Figure 1."

Roger: "... I think our culture in in massive denial and understandably so
because 30 years ago before everything was broadly honky-dory, and we were 
going to be able to have a high consumer lifestyle,
and now we've just faced this reality ... now the science would seem 
to imply that it's going to need a massive reduction in living standards 
because we're gonna have to put so much of our collective effort into dealing with
this situation which is reducing carbon emissions and taking the carbon
out of the atmosphere ... unfortunately there is this tendency in the political
class on the left and the right to lie to the population and say we can still
get out of this problem without a major reconfiguration of the economy
and that is inevitably going to mean lower living standards ..."

Roger: "we're not going to be dealing rationally with this problem.
I mean the idea that we're just all suddenly going to wake up and decide
to do the right thing it's a bit of a liberal illusion.
The most, I think the most predictable path is that we're going to slide into
fascism and the reason for that is because the elites are going to attempt to
protect their interest in the face of ever greater stress and when that happens you get
all for a chair in solutions and we've seen that across the world over the last ten years
and increasingly the rich and powerful will form right-wing movements and they'll
start to hollow out democracy because their main interest is protecting their own
wealth and power. Now obviously this is a completely suicidal mission because it's going
to end in their own destruction anyway but you can see the logic of that.
And what that means for people that are progressive or claim to be liberal is
you've got to make a choice. You know, because it's not going to get any easier every year that
goes on, right, they're going to sort this thing out with some major distress and upheaval
or we're going to go into a complete social hell; and those are the two options..."

Roger: "... unless people engage and go through emotion, they will not find the strength to 
engage in resistance. So we're not in the territory anymore of sending emails or going on
a to be marchers, you know, writing to representatives and what-have-you. That's all failed.
What we're in business of doing now as has happened in previous times in 20th century
in 19th century, you just need to look at history, people in would go to the streets and 
they blockade it, and they make sacrifices and they potentially get killed.
And that's where we're at. There's no dispute about this anymore, that's where we're at..."

"A million species of animals and plants are threatened with extinction.
Three quarters of the world's land and two-thirds of its marine environments
have been 'significantly altered' by human action. 
Urban areas have doubled in size in just the past 30 years. 
More than 85% of wetlands have been lost. More than 90% of ocean fish
stocks are being harvested at or above sustainable levels.
